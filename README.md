   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/munnamt/CriticLean.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CriticLean
   ```

3. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using CriticLean for your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the core functionalities:

```python
from critic_lean import Critic

# Initialize the Critic
critic = Critic()

# Example input
input_data = "Your mathematical problem here"

# Get the output
output = critic.solve(input_data)
print(output)
```

For more detailed examples and use cases, check the documentation or explore the examples folder in the repository.
