## 💡 Introduction
The formalization of mathematical statements into executable code for theorem provers like Lean 4 remains a critical challenge in computational mathematics. While existing methods have made progress in autoformalization, they often struggle with accuracy—particularly for complex problems requiring deep semantic understanding. This paper argues that the underexplored "critic" phase, which evaluates whether generated formalizations align with original mathematical intent, is essential for advancing this field.

To address these limitations, we introduce **CriticLean** , a framework prioritizing a critic-driven pipeline. At its core is **CriticLeanGPT** , a reinforcement learning-based model trained to assess the semantic fidelity of Lean 4 outputs against natural language statements. Our iterative process combines feedback from both the Lean compiler and CriticLeanGPT to refine formalizations, enhancing robustness through successive improvements.

We also present **CriticLeanBench** , a benchmark containing 500 paired natural language and Lean 4 statements (250 correct, 250 incorrect), enabling rigorous evaluation of critic models. Experiments show CriticLeanGPT outperforms state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models in accuracy.

Building on this pipeline, we develop **FineLeanCorpus** , an open-source dataset of 285,957 verified Lean 4 statements. Compared to prior datasets, it offers greater diversity in mathematical domains, difficulty levels, and quality, validated through iterative critical feedback.

By centering the formalization process on semantic validation, our work advances the reliability of automated theorem proving and provides scalable resources for future research in mathematical AI.

### 📋 CriticLeanBench
#### Overview

CriticLeanBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the critical reasoning capabilities of models in translating natural language mathematical statements into formally verified theorem declarations in Lean 4. This benchmark focuses on assessing whether generated Lean 4 code accurately reflects the semantic intent of original mathematical statements, addressing a key gap in existing evaluation frameworks for mathematical autoformalization.
- **Dual Focus**: Integrates both critic capabilities and Lean 4 formal verification, distinguishing itself from existing benchmarks
- **Diverse Coverage**: Includes problems from various mathematical domains and difficulty levels
- **Structured Errors**: Incorrect samples are designed to exhibit common error patterns in mathematical formalization
- **Human-Verified**: All samples undergo rigorous human validation to ensure quality and accuracy

</p>

#### Statistics
With 500 carefully curated problem pairs (250 correct and 250 incorrect formalizations), CriticLeanBench provides a rigorous testbed for models tasked with evaluating the correctness of mathematical formalizations. Each problem features relatively lengthy inputs (average 700.94 tokens), challenging models to process and understand complex mathematical reasoning.

CriticLeanBench is unique in its integration of Lean 4 specific evaluation and its focus on mathematical formalization correctness.

- A label indicating whether the formalization is semantically correct
- Detailed error annotations for incorrect samples (where applicable)


##### Evaluation Metrics

We recommend using the following metrics when evaluating models on CriticLeanBench:
- Accuracy (ACC)
- True Positive Rate (TPR)
- False Positive Rate (FPR)
- True Negative Rate (TNR)
- False Negative Rate (FNR)
